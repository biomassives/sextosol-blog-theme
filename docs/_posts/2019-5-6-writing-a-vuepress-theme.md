# Helping rural people create solutions for their families and communities

## Celebrating 19 years of service to communities in the Sierra Madre

The Sexto Sol Center for Community Action serves impoverished communities in Chiapas and Guatemala where a change of vision and specific technical assistance can help people create a better life. Since 1997 we have assisted people to create success with cooperative businesses, grow health-giving food, improve neglected schools for their children, regain cultural pride, protect the watershed, create eco-villages and heal from the trauma of disaster and war. We advocate internationally for the respect of indigenous rights, and environmental and economic justice.

One of our main strategies is to encourage community members to work _together_ to solve common problems and reach shared goals, an ethic we call "community action" or "acción comunitaria." When a group of people have success from working together, they gain the confidence to strive for even greater improvements that will benefit everyone.

According to the Mayan calendar, the world has just entered the Sixth Sun,  
**El Sexto Sol**, the time of Justice and of the emancipation of indigenous peoples. And as humanity faces the challenges and opportunities of these times, it will take the focused attention of so-called ordinary people to identify the solutions that we are capable of putting in place. It is time to refashion the world so that all people can finally enjoy health and peace in harmony with all life on our amazing planet. We hope to inspire others to exercise their own compassion be they our supporters, volunteers or interns. We work in one corner of the world in a way we hope ripples out beyond. We also encourage people everywhere to believe that they can make a difference in the world. It begins with practising kindness.

## Sexto Sol's Programs and Projects

The work of the Sexto Sol Center has evolved over the years since the projects that we do are a response to the requests we receive from the people for our involvement. Our main program areas are: sustainable livelihoods, sustainable food production, environment, improving schools, and advocating for human rights and human-centered policy. Typically at any one time we work on a select few projects that fit into these areas of expertise. We teach local people how to grow their own food organically at our permaculture farm Escuela de Agroecología y Permacultura Tierra Linda in Motozintla, Chiapas, Mexico.

We are pleased to announce our newest program International Partners for Healing, or, Alianza Internacional para la Superación Emocional. IPH brings the hope of emotional haling to places in our world where large populations are suffering from the traumas caused by conflict, natural disaster and other overwhelming challenges. IPH partners provide training in highly effective therapies to local healers so that they can help their own communities to heal. [**Read**](http://www.sextosol.org/International_Partners.html) a description of the program, the impact it will have, and the incredible partners with whom we are proud to work.

Imagine the human potential that could be released when people heal from the paralysing effects of collective trauma. We need that force now to implement real solutions to the problems facing humanity for the betterment of all people.

## The only obstacle to the realization of a world without poverty is the limit of our creativity.

On a planet with incredibly abundant biodiversity, water and renewable resources, poverty should be viewed by everyone as an aberration. It _is_ possible to create a sustainable world in which all people live with dignity in harmony with nature. It starts with imagining a future for our world in which all Earth's creatures live in harmonious relationship. Each one of us is part of the solution. Together we change the world.
