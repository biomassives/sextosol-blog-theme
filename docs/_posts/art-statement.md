summary: creating art is the perfect anti-depressant, and in that healing power, I
  can find myself

Art makes me happy and brings me extreme joy. I have drawn my whole life. I get lost in the experience and find that creating art is the perfect anti-depressant, and in that healing power, I can find myself. When the waking world leaves me weary, I always find solace getting in the flow of creating art.

As part of my education in Metaphysical Healing and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (Masters and Doctoral Degrees) I was trained in Intuitive Art Therapy. Using pastels and markers, the image that emerges can be analyzed by reading the energy that it represents and, perhaps finding a message in the shapes and forms. I have the pleasure of teaching this art form.

I recently redefined my life after a disabling accident seven years ago left me with pain that blocked my natural abilities to access my psychic awareness and intuitive abilities as a medium.

After learning Alcohol Ink, something wonderful and magical happened! My psychic abilities awakened once again, empowering me to feel that cosmic conscious connection and spiritual energy.
