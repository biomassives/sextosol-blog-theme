## Community Liaison for Water Projects

He is well known and respected in the farthest communities for having worked to help small scale coffee farmers sell their coffee. He is employed by the Ctiy of Motozintla to monitor the needs of remote communities for the municipality. Isaac identifies communities that need assistance to upgrade their water systems and serves as the liaison between local leaders and Sexto Sol. His participation is invaluable for the success of Sexto Sol's potable water program.

Sexto Sol Co-founder and Program Coordinator for 20 years. Francisco believed that poverty in his native Sierra Madre will end when the people realize that they need an "intellectual" revolution, one that leads them to change the ways they might unintentionally be perpetuating the root causes of the poverty they suffer. His idea of harnessing the collective power of small farmers in order to better market coffee was the guiding vision that launched Sexto Sol. He applied his mechanical aptitude to designing systems and appropriate technology in order to help people live better. Sexto Sol's mission was his life's work. With his passing, he has become part of the history of the Sierra Madre region that he so loved. "El Ing" is remembered with great affection for having truly made an impact in the lives of thousands of people.
