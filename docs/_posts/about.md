Native Floridian and artist, Mary Holtz, has always had the passion and skills for interpreting the visual whether seen through the eyes or felt in the spirit. Her life passions are healing those in need and creating art in mixed mediums. An avid photographer, Mary has experience and education in alcohol ink, acrylics, wire wrapping jewelry, crafting, Sumi-e-ink art, Japanese floral design, Ikebana, and intuitive pastel art.

Her energy for art is unending even as she has spent the last forty-six years healing the sick and needy as a Registered Nurse, an Acupuncture Physician, and a Transpersonal Psycho-Spiritual Therapist. In 2010 she received a Ph.D. in Metaphysical Healing and Transpersonal Psycho-Spiritual Therapy which included intuitive art interpretation. Her mediumship skills bring an insightful understanding of her art forms.

Recently, she has been educated in the field of alcohol ink taking classes from Linda Clifford and Alexis Bonavitacola.

She prides herself on seeing color, shape, and dimension not through conventional eyes but through deep, other-dimensional energy. She currently shows her art at craft fairs, restaurants, and local community events.
