Native Floridian and artist, Mary Holtz, has always had the passion and skills for interpreting the visual whether seen through the eyes or felt in the spirit. Her life passions are healing the needy and creating art in mixed mediums. An avid photographer, Mary has the experience and education in acrylics, wire wrapping jewelry, crafting, Sumi-e-ink art, Japanese floral design, Ikebana, and intuitive pastel art.

Her energy for art is unending even as she has spent the last forty-six years healing the sick and needy as a nurse, an acupuncture physician, and a transpersonal psycho-spiritual therapist. In 2010 she received a Ph.D. in Metaphysical Healing and Transpersonal Psycho-Spiritual Therapy which included intuitive art interpretation. Her mediumship skills bring an insightful understanding to her Intuitive Art Classes. She is extremely unique.

Recently, she has been educated in the field of alcohol ink taking classes from Linda Clifford and Alexis Bonavitacola.

She prides herself for seeing color, shape, and dimension not through conventional eyes but through a deep, other-dimensional energy. She currently shows her art in craft fairs, restaurants, and local community events. If interested in Intuitive Art classes, you can find Mary on Facebook.
